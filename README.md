# Marketing Data Analytics

Welcome to the **Marketing Data Analytics** project! ðŸš€

This project is designed to analyze and visualize marketing campaign performance using Python, SQL, and Google Data Studio. The goal is to extract actionable insights from marketing data to help improve campaign strategies and optimize advertising spend.

### Project Overview
In this project, I analyze marketing data for various campaigns, including key metrics such as:
- **Ad Spend**
- **Impressions**
- **Clicks**
- **Conversions**
- **Revenue**
- **Conversion Rate**

Using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn), I process and clean the data, calculate important KPIs, and visualize the results to provide a deeper understanding of the campaign performance. The data is stored in an SQLite database, and queries are executed to generate insights for further analysis. Finally, the results are visualized using **Google Data Studio** for an interactive reporting experience.

### Key Features:
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Load and clean marketing data using Python.
- **SQL Database Integration**: Store and query marketing data using an SQLite database.
- **Visualization**: Create insightful charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** in Python.
- **Reporting**: Use **Google Data Studio** to connect and create interactive dashboards for visualizing campaign performance.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **SQL**: SQLite for storing and querying data.
- **Google Data Studio**: For creating visualizations and reports.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
